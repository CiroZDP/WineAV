# WineAV
**WineAV** is an antivirus programmed by [Ciro](https://github.com/CiroZDP) that works with databases.
I didn't put so much effort, this was just a hobby project that I founded in my computer.

I published it here so many people can help to the develop of this antivirus. Even you can create your own antivirus using this as a *base*.

## Advances
This is what the menu looks like:
```
 ==== WINEAV SIBERMATICA ====
   1. Scan a file
   2. Add hash
   3. Remove hash
   4. See stored hashes
   5. See saved hashes
   6. Save database
   7. Load database / Discard changes
   8. Change database location
   9. Lockup status
  10. Merge databases
  11. Mark file as malicious
  12. Clear hashes
  13. Unmark malicious file
  14. Scan directory
   0. Quit
```

And you can select any option.

## Ideas ðŸ’¡
- I don't need GUI for this antivirus. It's useless to do something like that for such a small project.
- Online servers for updating definitions.
- I want to implement a definition system that makes all versions of the antivirus support the same version of definitions. This way there are no compatibility problems.
